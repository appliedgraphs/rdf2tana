## New converters

When creating new converters, be sure to add unit tests to make sure they are doing what was intended.

We'll glady take PR's for any public formats. If you are writing a converter for some obscure internal format, chances are it will only be relevant for you and your company.

## Bugs

When fixing bugs for existing converters, please add a test that verifies the bug first.
